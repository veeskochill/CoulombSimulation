# CoulombSimulation

Write a command line program (in a language of your choice) to simulate in 2D the trajectory of a test particle in proximity to a thin electrically charged ring.  The program should take the following values as parameters:
- initial conditions of the test particle (mass, charge, initial position, initial velocity)
- radius of the charged ring (cm)
- filename of .csv containing angular charge distribution on the ring. (degrees, microcoulombs/cm) - an example is attached
- filename of .csv to output the resulting trajectory (time, x, y) over some time period

In addition define at least 3 tests (input data sets paired with checks on the outputs) that confirm the simulation is behaving correctly. I.e. these tests should break if you changed Coulomb's law.
